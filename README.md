# DiscordBot


### What the bot can do:

1. Delete messages with Permission Check <br>
2. Move a specific client (Only for me function) <br>
3. Information: info/!Help/help <br>
4. Write in spetsalno channel when someone entered / left <br>
5. YouTube link + space + time in minutes! -> converts to a short link with time (for phones users)
