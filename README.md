# DiscordBot


### What the bot can do:

1. Delete messages with Permission Check <br>
2. Move a specific client (Only for me function) <br>
3. Available Commands: info/!help/help <br>
4. Write to the special channel when someone entered/left  <br>
5. YouTube link + space + time in minutes! -> converts to a short link with time (for phones users)  <br>
